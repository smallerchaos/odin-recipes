Recipes Project from HTML Foundations in The Odin Project

Though this was largely a review since I have experience working with HTML, I found the information on setting up a Github repository, writting good commit messages, and viewing Github Pages to be the most helpful. I have been enjoying The Odin Project so far because I feel like it gives more comprehensive and realistic information pertaining to becoming a developer than all other sources I have seen so far. (Granted, I haven't looked at that many.)

Something else that was interesting was the rel="noreferrer" attribute for links. I hadn't heard of this before (perhaps my knowledge is dated) but it's kind of scary to know that links and then websites you had been at could be modified after the fact by just clicking on a link.

Brushing up on terminal has also been pretty great though I do find myself wanting VIM-like capabilities in the comfort of VSCode. I'm not sure if it would be better to do something to VIM to allow autocomplete or do something to VSCode to allow VIM-like capabilities.
